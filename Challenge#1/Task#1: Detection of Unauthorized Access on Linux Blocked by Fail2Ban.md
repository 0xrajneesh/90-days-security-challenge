**Objective**: Set up monitoring for unauthorized access attempts, trigger Fail2Ban to block malicious IPs, and analyze logs in Splunk.

---

### **Step-by-Step Instructions**

### **Step 1: Prerequisites**

1. Ensure you have an **Ubuntu Server** ready for this task.
2. Install the necessary tools:
    - Fail2Ban for SSH protection.
    - Splunk Universal Forwarder for log forwarding.

---

### **Step 2: Install and Configure Fail2Ban**

1. **Install Fail2Ban**:
    
    ```bash
    
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install fail2ban -y
    
    ```
    
2. **Configure Fail2Ban for SSH**:
    - Open the Fail2Ban configuration file:
        
        ```bash
        
        sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
        
        ```
        
    - Add the following lines to protect the SSH service:
        
        ```
        [sshd]
        enabled = true
        port = ssh
        logpath = /var/log/auth.log
        maxretry = 3
        bantime = 600
        findtime = 600
        
        ```
        
    - Save and close the file.
3. **Add Restart Fail2Ban** to apply changes:
    
    ```bash
    /opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk add monitor /var/log/fail2ban.log
    sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
    
    ```
    
4. **Verify Fail2Ban Status**:
    
    ```bash
    
    sudo fail2ban-client status
    
    ```
    
    Look for the `sshd` jail in the output.
    
5. Create index and sourcetype in Splunk platform
    
    ```css
    Create index and sourcetype and name them as fail2ban_logs
    ```

### **Step 3: Simulate Unauthorized SSH Access**

1. 
    
    ```bash
    ssh user@<target-ip>
    
    ```
    

### **Step 3: Simulate a Brute-Force Attack with Hydra**

1. **Prepare a wordlist** with common passwords:
    - Use a pre-existing wordlist (e.g., `/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`) or create a custom one:
        
        ```bash
        
        echo -e "password123\nadmin123\n12345678\ntestpass" > passwords.txt
        
        ```
        
2. **Run Hydra** to perform the brute-force attack:
    
    ```bash
    
    hydra -l testuser -P passwords.txt <target-ip> ssh
    
    ```
    
    - Replace `<target-ip>` with the IP address of the Ubuntu server.
3. **Observe Fail2Ban Action**:
    - As the attack progresses, Fail2Ban will detect multiple failed login attempts and block the attacking IP.
    - Check Fail2Ban logs on the server:
        
        ```bash
        
        tail -f /var/log/fail2ban.log
        
        ```
        
4. **Monitor Fail2Ban Logs**:
    
    ```bash
    
    tail -f /var/log/fail2ban.log
    
    ```
    
    - Check for entries indicating that Fail2Ban has banned the attacking IP.

### **Step 4: Configure Splunk for Log Monitoring**

1. Make sure your Universal forwarder is up and running on Ubuntu server.
2. **Set up log forwarding for Fail2Ban**:
    - Create an input configuration:
        
        ```bash
        
        sudo nano /opt/splunkforwarder/etc/system/local/inputs.conf
        
        ```
        
    - Add the following configuration to monitor Fail2Ban logs:
        
        ```
        
        [monitor:///var/log/fail2ban.log]
        sourcetype = fail2ban_logs
        index = fail2ban_logs
        
        ```
        
    - Save and restart the Splunk Universal Forwarder:
        
        ```bash
        
        sudo /opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk restart
        
        ```
        

---

### **Step 5: Analyze Logs in Splunk**

1. **Log in to Splunk** and navigate to the Search and Reporting App.
2. Use the following SPL query to identify blocked IPs:
    
    ```
    
    index=linux_logs sourcetype=fail2ban action="ban"
    
    ```
    
3. **Visualize Results**:
    - Create a dashboard to monitor trends of failed login attempts and banned IPs.

---

### **Step 6: Validate Incident Response**

1. **Validate Banned IPs**:
    
    ```bash
    
    sudo fail2ban-client status sshd
    
    ```
    
    Verify the attacking IP is listed as banned.
    
2. **Unban IPs (if needed)**:
    
    ```bash
    
    sudo fail2ban-client set sshd unbanip <banned-ip>
    
    ```
