### Objective

The objective of this task is to monitor and detect unauthorized modifications, deletions, or attribute changes in sensitive directories, such as `/etc/`, using **Auditd** for real-time monitoring and **Splunk** for centralized log analysis. By simulating potential threats, such as file tampering or deletion, students will gain hands-on experience in setting up file integrity monitoring, analyzing logs for forensic purposes, and implementing incident response strategies to secure critical system files.    
- **Detailed level**: Full
- **Difficulty level**: Medium

What is Auditd?

- **System Activity Logging**: Auditd monitors and records system events like file access, user actions, and configuration changes.
- **Security and Compliance**: Helps meet compliance standards by maintaining a detailed log of critical events.
- **Customizable Rules**: Allows administrators to define specific audit rules to monitor sensitive files, processes, or activities.
- **Real-time Alerts**: Supports real-time notifications for suspicious or unauthorized actions.

### **Tools Used**

1. **Auditd**: For monitoring file integrity.
2. **Splunk Universal Forwarder**: For forwarding logs to Splunk.
3. **Splunk**: For analyzing and visualizing logs.

### **Step-by-Step Guide**

---

### **Step 1: Prerequisites**

1. An **Ubuntu Server** with sudo privileges.
2. **Auditd** installed for file integrity monitoring.
3. **Splunk Universal Forwarder** installed and configured to forward logs.
4. A directory or file to monitor (e.g., `/etc/passwd` or `/etc/`).

### **Step 2: Install and Configure Auditd**

1. **Install Auditd**:
    
    ```bash
    
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install auditd -y
    
    ```
    
2. **Start and Enable Auditd**:
    
    ```bash
    bash
    Copy code
    systemctl start auditd
    systemctl enable auditd
    
    ```
    
3. **Verify Auditd Status**:
    
    ```bash
    
    sudo systemctl status auditd
    
    ```

### **Step 3: Set Up File Monitoring Rules**

1. **Add Audit Rules for File Integrity Monitoring**:
    - Open the audit rules configuration file:
        
        ```bash
        
        sudo nano /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules
        
        ```
        
    - Add the following rule to monitor `/etc/` for any changes:
        
        ```bash
        
        -w /etc/ -p wa -k file_integrity
        
        ```
        
        - `w`: Watch the specified directory.
        - `p`: Permissions to monitor:
            - `w`: Write.
            - `a`: Attribute changes.
        - `k`: Keyword to tag events for easier searching (e.g., `file_integrity`).
2. **Reload Auditd**:
    
    ```bash
    bash
    Copy code
    sudo service auditd restart
    
    ```
    
3. **Verify Rules**:
    
    ```bash
    
    sudo auditctl -l
    
    ```

### **Step 4: Install and Configure Splunk Universal Forwarder**

1. **Install Splunk Universal Forwarder**:
    - Ensure it is installed and running propoerly
2. **Configure Splunk to Monitor Auditd Logs**:
    - Edit the `inputs.conf` file:
        
        ```bash
        
        sudo nano /opt/splunkforwarder/etc/system/local/inputs.conf
        
        ```
        
    - Add the following entry:
        
        ```
        
        [monitor:///var/log/audit/audit.log]
        sourcetype = auditd
        index = linux_file_integrity
        
        ```
        
    - Save and restart Splunk Forwarder:
        
        ```bash
        
        sudo /opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk restart
        
        ```
        
3. **Verify Log Forwarding**:
    - Use this query in Splunk to search for Auditd logs:
        
        ```
        
        index=linux_file_integrity sourcetype=auditd
        
        ```
        

### **Step 5: Simulate Unauthorized Changes**

1. **Modify a File**:
    - Make a change to `/etc/passwd` to simulate unauthorized modification:Add or remove a line, then save and exit.
        
        ```bash
        bash
        Copy code
        sudo nano /etc/passwd
        
        ```
        
2. **Delete a File**:
    - Delete a file in `/etc/` (ensure it is non-critical for this test):
        
        ```bash
        bash
        Copy code
        sudo rm /etc/testfile
        
        ```
        
3. **List Audit Logs**:
    - Use `ausearch` to find log entries for the simulated actions:
        
        ```bash
        bash
        Copy code
        sudo ausearch -k file_integrity
        
        ```

### **Step 6: Install Auditd for Linux App from Splunkbase**

- Go to More Apps
- Search for **Auditd for Linux App**
- Install the app

### **Step 6: Analyze Logs in Splunk**

1. **Search for File Integrity Events**:
    - Run the following query in Splunk:
        
        ```
        index=linux_logs sourcetype=auditd key="file_integrity"
        ```
        
    - This query will filter events tagged with the `file_integrity` keyword.
    - Note: Its all possible because of Aud
2. **Investigate Specific Events**:
    - Analyze the logs for unauthorized modifications. Example:
        
        ```bash
        
        type=SYSCALL msg=audit(1667829100.123:123): arch=c000003e syscall=2 success=yes exit=0 a0=7ffc12345 a1=80400 a2=1 items=2 ppid=2345 pid=4567 auid=1000 uid=0 gid=0 euid=0
        ```
        
3. **Visualize Events**:
    - Create a dashboard to monitor:
        - Files most frequently modified.
        - Users responsible for the changes.
        - Time trends for integrity violations.

---

### **Step 7: Incident Response**

1. **Identify the User**:
    - Extract the user who made the changes from the log.
    - Example: `auid=1000` to a specific user ID.
2. **Restore the File**:
    - If critical files are altered or deleted, restore them from a backup.
3. **Implement Additional Controls**:
    - Set permissions to restrict access to sensitive files:
